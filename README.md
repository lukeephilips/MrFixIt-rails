## Description

To be honest, I'm embarrassed by this work. Starting from badly built app through my for a loop and I definitely need to find some resources to learn AJAX better. I thought I knew enough to get by, but I'm once again lost in the mysteries of JavaScript. While I technically did use AJAX to accomplish the requirements, it looks and feels worse than if I'd just used pure Ruby. My tests pass but they don't actually accomplish anything. BOOOOOOOOO! :(



users can:
Users can register for basic user accounts. These accounts allow them to post jobs.
Basic users can log into their accounts.
Basic users may post their jobs to the jobs list.
Basic users have the option to sign up for a Worker account, which allows them to claim and complete jobs.
A worker can claim a job, and see it in their "Worker Dashboard"

Workers can:
claim a job via an AJAX action.
mark which jobs they're actively working on using AJAX.
mark jobs "complete" using AJAX.
